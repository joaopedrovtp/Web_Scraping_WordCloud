# Web Scraping and Wordcloud

In this project I used python Web Scraping to create a wordcloud with trending words of 10 recent articles content from Coin Telegraph website (https://cointelegraph.com/). It's a media website covering blockchain technology and crypto assets.

For that I used libraries like Beautiful Soup(web scraping), NLTK (Natural languague processing) and worldcloud(https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud).

Result:

That was just for fun, but what if I say that someday I want to know the trending topics from this page or maybe any website? That would be great! My thanks to @DataScienceAcademy and @Datacamp for the helping content :)
